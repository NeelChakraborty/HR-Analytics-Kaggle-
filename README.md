## About this Notebook
### Objectives:
1. Exploring data and differentiating between employees who are leaving the company and those who have chosen to stay till now.
This part mainly consists of visualization to get a feel of the distribution for different groups of employees.
2. Find out the important factors which dictate the turnover of the employees.
This was done using univariate feature selection. Univariate feature selection works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests.
3. Fit prediction models and find out which employees might leave next.
The models used here are Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine along with GridSearchCV.

All the above objectives are divided into two parts.
1. For all employees in general.
2. For highly evaluated employees.
